            <p>Hello! I'm Steven Brady, a passionate computer programmer with a strong background in web development and API integration.</p>

            <p>My journey in tech started at Lane Community College in Eugene, OR, where I earned my Associate of Applied Science in Computer Programming with a 3.6 GPA. Through dedication, I financed 100% of my tuition and living expenses while working part-time.</p>

            <p>Proficient in various programming languages including C#, JavaScript, and Python, I have a knack for creating efficient and user-friendly digital solutions. My internship at OCDLA allowed me to enhance my technical skills and contribute to meaningful projects, like the 'Saved Payment Methods' feature of the OCDLA online store utilizing the Authorize.net API.</p>

            <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the skies with my drone, capturing breathtaking aerial photography. I'm enthusiastic about continuous learning and always looking for the next challenge!</p>

            <p>Feel free to connect with me if you're interested in collaborating or if you'd like to learn more about my work.</p>
