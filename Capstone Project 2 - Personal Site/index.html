    <p>Steven Brady: Aspiring Full Stack Developer

      Currently completing an Associate's degree in Software Development at Lane Community College in Eugene, Oregon, I specialize in full-stack development with a strong foundation in C#, JavaScript, HTML, .NET Core MVC, and SQL. My academic journey also includes beginning and intermediate courses in Python and C++, further diversifying my skillset. In my spare time, I'm expanding my expertise into mobile app development through a focused Kotlin course.
      
      Core Skills:
      
          Languages: C#, JavaScript, HTML, Python, C++, Kotlin
          Frameworks: .NET Core MVC
          Databases: SQL
          Mobile Development: Kotlin (beginner)
      
      Whether it's building robust web applications or exploring the world of mobile app development, I'm committed to leveraging technology to create intuitive and impactful digital solutions.
